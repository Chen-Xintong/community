# Contribution seat allocation formula

The [steering committee charter](CHARTER.md) states "Each year, when
Contribution Seat terms begin, the Steering Committee will vote on an exact
formula and procedure for determining allocation for the following year."

For the February 2022 to January 2023 term, the contribution formula shall be
**contributions** (review, comment, commit, issue or PR on GitHub) attributed to a Contributing Company,
and the [D'Hondt method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method) of
allocation of seats.

Attribution is done using the [cncf/gitdm](https://github.com/cncf/gitdm) developer affiliation files.
Changes to attribution can be made by pull request to that repository.

[The method and results for 2021-2022 are published here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/187LDk96ggccHa_IBBGLEHYEBmR5eidsEQUDy2nE9kxo/edit).
